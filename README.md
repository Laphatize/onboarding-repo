# Welcome to TQL's Onboarding Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to Plutus Trading Labs and the Quant division! We are excited to have you on board as a developer for one of our many potential projects! This repository is a very important oneâ€”this is your dummy repository to practice your source control essentials!

## Source Control Overview

GitHub is basically the software development version of Google Docs, except for a few things here and there. You can collaborate on code together (not in real-time sadly) and can even edit different parts of the same document to create a collective resource!

We will be posting tutorials on how to use GitHub in a professional environment soon!

## TASK 0: Adding Your Profile to Our List of Developers

NOTE: Before doing this task, you are required to understand the fundamentals of source control, branching, push/pull commands, the terminal, and pull requests. It is also a bonus if you have an idea of how coding works in collaborative environments!

<strong>TASK: </strong>As part of our onboarding requirement, you are required to add your name to our developers page on the <code>developers.html</code> file! Create a pull request and have your change accepted by one of the tech leads! Please make sure to follow proper standards in coding syntax and follow the guidelines for creating a PR!

## Resources

As always, referring back to resources and documentation is something that is key to becoming a well-rounded developer. You will be spending a lot of time learning how to use lines of code you aren't familar with, so please make sure to take the time to review our guidelines!

PTL manages all documentation details through the Confluence page located <a href="https://plutustradinglabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PTL/pages/98452/The+Quant+Lab">here!</a>
